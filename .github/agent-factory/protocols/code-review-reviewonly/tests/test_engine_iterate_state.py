"""Regression test for the iterate state-reset bug in the unified engine.

When an agent phase fails its gate, advance.py records the failed iteration
(iteration++, history += {iteration, checks, feedback}) and re-dispatches a
`protocol-continue` for the SAME phase. The re-dispatched `continue` runs next.py,
whose continue→agent arm calls enter_node(); enter_node's agent arm USED TO
re-seed the per-phase state file unconditionally ({iteration: 1, history: []}),
clobbering the iterate state advance.py had just written. That:
  - reset the iteration counter (defeating the `iter_ < max_iter` exhaustion
    guard — a persistently-failing gate would re-dispatch forever),
  - wiped the failed-iteration history (the status comment, a pure projection of
    `history`, then under-reported the retry), and
  - dropped the failure feedback the retried agent needs.

Both scenarios drive the REAL next.py as a subprocess (matching the suite's
subprocess convention) against a local bare git repo standing in for the
agentic-state remote:
  - ITERATE re-entry  → must PRESERVE state and thread iteration + feedback;
  - FIRST entry       → must still seed {iteration 1, history []}, publish it,
                        and emit iteration 1 / empty feedback (no regression).
