# Guided Overview + Risk — cohort partition, layered walkthrough, breaking-change findings

You produce a guided, layered walkthrough of a PR AND its breaking-change findings,
grouped into a SINGLE set of change cohorts shared by both, plus a one-line summary. The
agent does ONLY the AI judgment — partition cohorts, walk the layers, and classify
breaking changes; do not check out the repo, do not run any scripts, and do NOT compute
the risk score. The authoritative risk band is computed deterministically downstream by
the `conclude-overview` hook (a port of score.js/diffusion.js) from your breaking-change
`severityClass` values and cohort file blast radius. You MAY include an optional
`risk_band` HINT, but it is advisory only — the computed band wins.

1. Read `/tmp/gh-aw/agent/pr.json` (changed files: `files[].path`, `additions`, `deletions`;
   plus `title`, `body`, `headRefOid`), `/tmp/gh-aw/agent/pr.diff`, and
   `/tmp/gh-aw/task-context.json` (`pr`, `iteration`, `feedback` — fold any prior `feedback`
   into this pass; `inputs` carries upstream evidence when present).

2. **Split the change into one or more INDEPENDENT CHANGE COHORTS — groups of related work
   that can each be understood on their own. A small PR may be a single cohort.** Every changed
   file belongs to exactly one cohort. Assign each cohort an `area` for routing, one of:
   `security`, `frontend`, `backend`, `data`, `infra`, `docs`, `tests`.

3. Within each cohort, break the work into LAYERS ordered by build dependency, the way a senior
   engineer would walk a colleague through it. Typical progression:
   schema → backend → api → frontend → tests. Use `other` for layers fitting none of these.
   For EACH layer record: `layer` (one of schema|backend|api|frontend|tests|other), `order`
   (1-based within the cohort), `area` (same vocabulary as above), `title` (≤8 words),
   `summary` (2-3 sentences, relative to the previous layer), `files` (repo-relative paths
   exactly as in the diff headers), `diff` (≤30 relevant unified-diff lines), and OPTIONAL
   `diagram` (a Mermaid source string; omit the field entirely when not useful).

4. For each cohort, **detect breaking changes** to the PUBLIC API against the **APIDiff taxonomy**,
   language-general via per-language public-symbol cues (Go: exported identifiers; JS/TS: `export`s;
   Python: public names without a leading underscore). Classify each finding's `severityClass`:
   - `hard-break` — REMOVE_TYPE / REMOVE_METHOD / REMOVE_FIELD, LOST_VISIBILITY,
     CHANGE_IN_RETURN_TYPE, CHANGE_IN_PARAMETER_LIST, CHANGE_IN_FIELD_TYPE / SUPERTYPE /
     EXCEPTION_LIST (signature/semantic-modifying).
   - `recoverable-refactor` — RENAME_* / MOVE_* / PUSH_DOWN_* / INLINE_* (semantic-preserving;
     a client can adapt mechanically).
   Removing a **deprecated** element is NON-breaking — do not record it. Likewise, replacing or
   implementing a **stub / placeholder** (a `501 Not Implemented` route, a `NotImplementedError`,
   a TODO/empty body) with a real implementation is NON-breaking — do not record it. Behavioral-only
   changes that preserve the signature are out of scope. A cohort with no public-API change has
   `"bcFindings":[]`.

5. OPTIONALLY include `risk_band`, one of `Low|Medium|High|Critical`, as an ADVISORY HINT
   only. The authoritative band is computed downstream by `conclude-overview` from your
   `bcFindings` severityClass + cohort file blast radius (score.js/diffusion.js) — do not
   agonize over it, and never treat it as the verdict. You may omit the field entirely.
   What matters most is accurate `bcFindings` (severityClass) and a complete cohort partition.

6. Write `/tmp/gh-aw/evidence.json` (the engine evidence path) as ONE JSON object, using the
   `edit` tool:
   `{"cohorts":[{"cohort":"…","cohortOrder":1,"area":"backend","files":["…"],"layers":[{"layer":"backend","order":1,"area":"backend","title":"…","summary":"…","files":["…"],"diff":"…","diagram":"…"}],"bcFindings":[{"symbol":"…","kind":"type|method|field","category":"REMOVE_METHOD|…","severityClass":"hard-break|recoverable-refactor","evidence":"…"}]}],"summary":"one sentence on what this PR does at a high level","risk_band":"Low|Medium|High|Critical"}`
   `cohortOrder` is a 1-based integer ordering the cohorts. `risk_band` is OPTIONAL (an
   advisory hint; the authoritative band is computed downstream). Write nothing else, then call `noop`.
   Never post comments, never use other safe-outputs, never write to the repository.
