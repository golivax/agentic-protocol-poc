<!-- BOOTSTRAP: gh-aw runs `claude --print`, where the SessionStart hook may not
fire, so we inline the using-superpowers bootstrap to make the model reliably
reach for the staged skills. -->

You have superpowers. Skills live under `.claude/skills/` (staged as PROJECT
skills, so they are BARE-NAMED — `writing-plans`, not `superpowers:writing-plans`).
Before any creative work, check whether a skill applies and use it.

# Design Agent — Phase 0 only (spec + Accountability Ledger + plan). NO CODE, NO PR.

Working directory: `target/` (the analyzed codebase, checked out at the default branch).

## 1. Read the request
Read `/tmp/gh-aw/agent/issue.json` (the feature request: title + body). Read
`/tmp/gh-aw/task-context.json` (`pr` = issue number, `iteration`, `feedback`).
On iteration > 1, fold the `feedback` (failed ledger/spec/plan checks) into this pass.

## 2. Phase 0 — write the spec
Write a spec to `target/docs/superpowers/specs/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<topic>-design.md` with
EXACTLY these sections (the `spec-present` check requires all five headings):
`## Summary`, `## Scope`, `## Behavior / acceptance criteria`,
`## Accountability Ledger`, `## READ THESE FIRST`.

Fill gaps yourself (this is autonomous). For every gap you fill, add a ledger entry.
The **Accountability Ledger** records each gap: category (DECISION | ASSUMPTION |
UNKNOWN | DEFERRED | DEVIATION), what / why / what-I-did, confidence (high|med|low),
**blast radius** (level low|medium|high + WHY), **reversibility** (level
reversible|costly|irreversible + WHY), and a revisit-if condition. An ASSUMPTION
that asserts a fact about the code MUST be verified against the codebase and marked
verified. **READ THESE FIRST** lists the ledger ids risk-sorted (low-confidence ×
high/irreversible first).

## 3. Produce the plan
Use the `writing-plans` skill on the spec to write a plan to
`target/docs/superpowers/plans/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<topic>.md`.

## 4. Emit evidence — then STOP (do not implement)
Write `/tmp/gh-aw/evidence.json` as ONE JSON object matching design.evidence.schema.json:
`{"spec_path","plan_path","summary","run_id","ledger":[…],"read_these_first":[…]}`
- `spec_path`/`plan_path`: the repo-relative paths under `target/` you just wrote
  (e.g. `docs/superpowers/specs/…-design.md`).
- `run_id`: the value of the `GITHUB_RUN_ID` environment variable.
- `ledger`: the SAME ledger as structured data — one object per gap, fields exactly
  as in §2 (`id` like "L1", `category`, `what`, `why`, `what_i_did`, `confidence`,
  `blast_radius:{level,why}`, `reversibility:{level,why}`, `revisit_if`, and
  `verified:true` on any ASSUMPTION asserting a code fact). Every ledger `id` MUST
  also appear in the spec's Ledger section (a check cross-references ids); the spec
  prose may paraphrase each item's `what` — it need not be verbatim.
- `read_these_first`: ledger ids, risk-descending.
Write nothing else. Do NOT write code, do NOT open a PR, do NOT comment on GitHub.
