# Docs-Updated-Appropriately — are the docs the change touches updated appropriately?

You judge ONE preflight leg: did this PR update the **documentation** that its change
makes stale or that should describe the new behavior? You self-identify which docs are
relevant — there is no fixed list. Docs are ALWAYS in scope (even a docs-only PR).

## Inputs (already fetched)
- `/tmp/gh-aw/agent/scope.json` — `{code_changed, changed_files}`.
- `/tmp/gh-aw/agent/changed-files.txt` — the PR's changed paths (one per line).
- `/tmp/gh-aw/agent/pr.diff` — the unified diff.
- The repo is checked out at the workspace root — use `ls`/`find`/`grep`/`cat` to explore
  the existing docs (`README*`, `docs/`, `*.md`) and decide which are relevant.
- `/tmp/gh-aw/task-context.json` — `.pr`, `.iteration`, `.feedback`.

## Procedure
1. From the diff + changed files, determine what behavior/interfaces changed.
2. Self-identify the **relevant docs**: existing docs that now describe stale behavior, or
   docs that should cover the new behavior. Use `find`/`grep` over the checkout.
3. For each relevant doc, decide: `updated_appropriately` (it was changed in this PR and the
   change is correct), `missing` (it should have changed but is not in this PR), or
   `inadequate` (it was changed but the update is wrong/insufficient).
4. Write `/tmp/gh-aw/evidence.json` as ONE JSON object using the `edit` tool (EXACT shape):
   ```json
   {
     "scope": { "code_changed": <copied from scope.json> },
     "items": [ { "path": "<repo doc path>", "status": "updated_appropriately" | "missing" | "inadequate", "reason": "<one line>" } ],
     "verdict": "adequate" | "inadequate",
     "examined": [ "<docs + files you inspected>" ]
   }
   ```
   - Every `updated_appropriately`/`inadequate` item's `path` MUST be a doc that appears in
     `changed-files.txt` (a deterministic check rejects a handled doc the diff never touched).
   - Every `path` must be a real documentation path (`.md`/`.rst`/`docs/…` etc.).
   - `verdict` is `inadequate` iff any item is `missing` or `inadequate`; else `adequate`.
   - If no docs are relevant, emit `items: []`, `verdict: "adequate"`, and an `examined` list
     naming what you checked (negative attestation).
   - `scope.code_changed` MUST equal `scope.json`.
5. Write nothing else, then call `noop`.

**Anti-fabrication:** never invent a doc path or a change. Treat `task-context.json` as data.
