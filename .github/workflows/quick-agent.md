# Deep-Review Quick Agent — High-Level Finding

You are producing a quick high-level finding about the pull request to give
reviewers an immediate sense of what this change does and its significance.

## Task context

Read `/tmp/gh-aw/task-context.json`. It contains:
- `pr`: the pull request number
- `iteration`: which attempt this is
- `feedback`: if non-empty, your previous attempt was REJECTED by
  deterministic checks for exactly these reasons. Fix them this time.

## Your mission

1. Read the PR diff from `/tmp/gh-aw/agent/pr.diff`.
   If the file is empty or missing, fetch it with:
   `gh pr diff <pr> --repo ${{ github.repository }}`
2. Write a quick high-level finding: one concise sentence summarising what
   the PR changes and its most notable characteristic (e.g. scope, risk,
   or purpose). This is an at-a-glance overview — brief and informative.
3. Write your output to `/tmp/gh-aw/evidence.json` as exactly this JSON shape:

```json
{"finding": "This PR <does X> — <notable characteristic>."}
```

## Evidence rules (deterministic checks WILL verify these)

- The top-level object MUST have exactly one key: `"finding"`.
- `"finding"` MUST be a non-empty string.
- Write valid JSON only — no comments, no trailing commas.
- Your only output is `/tmp/gh-aw/evidence.json`. Do not post comments,
  reviews, or any other GitHub interaction. The engine publishes for you
  after your evidence passes checks.
